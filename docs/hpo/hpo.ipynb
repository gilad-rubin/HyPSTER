    "## Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Combinations API provides a powerful foundation for various Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) techniques. By generating all valid configurations, you can systematically explore the hyperparameter space using different search strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search exhaustively tries all possible combinations. This is straightforward with the Combinations API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from hypster import HP, config\n",
    "import itertools\n",
    "\n",
    "@config\n",
    "def model_config(hp: HP):\n",
    "    learning_rate = hp.select([0.001, 0.01, 0.1])\n",
    "    batch_size = hp.select([32, 64, 128])\n",
    "    num_layers = hp.select([2, 3, 4])\n",
    "\n",
    "combinations = model_config.get_combinations()\n",
    "\n",
    "def evaluate_model(params):\n",
    "    # Your model training and evaluation code here\n",
    "    # Return a performance metric (e.g., accuracy)\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "best_params = None\n",
    "best_performance = float('-inf')\n",
    "\n",
    "for params in combinations:\n",
    "    performance = evaluate_model(params)\n",
    "    if performance > best_performance:\n",
    "        best_performance = performance\n",
    "        best_params = params\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Best parameters: {best_params}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Best performance: {best_performance}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Search samples randomly from the possible combinations, which can be more efficient for high-dimensional spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "num_trials = 20  # Number of random configurations to try\n",
    "random_combinations = random.sample(combinations, min(num_trials, len(combinations)))\n",
    "\n",
    "best_params = None\n",
    "best_performance = float('-inf')\n",
    "\n",
    "for params in random_combinations:\n",
    "    performance = evaluate_model(params)\n",
    "    if performance > best_performance:\n",
    "        best_performance = performance\n",
    "        best_params = params\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Best parameters: {best_params}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Best performance: {best_performance}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration with Optimization Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The Combinations API can be easily integrated with popular HPO libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optuna Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import optuna\n",
    "from hypster import query_combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "def objective(trial):\n",
    "    # Define the hyperparameter space\n",
    "    params = {\n",
    "        'learning_rate': trial.suggest_categorical('learning_rate', [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]),\n",
    "        'batch_size': trial.suggest_categorical('batch_size', [32, 64, 128]),\n",
    "        'num_layers': trial.suggest_categorical('num_layers', [2, 3, 4])\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Query valid combinations\n",
    "    valid_combinations = query_combinations(combinations, params)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if not valid_combinations:\n",
    "        return float('-inf')  # Invalid combination\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Use the first valid combination (there should only be one in this case)\n",
    "    config = valid_combinations[0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Your model training and evaluation code here\n",
    "    performance = evaluate_model(config)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return performance\n",
    "\n",
    "study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize')\n",
    "study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Best trial:\")\n",
    "trial = study.best_trial\n",
    "print(f\"  Value: {trial.value}\")\n",
    "print(\"  Params: \")\n",
    "for key, value in trial.params.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"    {key}: {value}\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Benefits of Using Combinations API for HPO\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constraint Handling**: The API automatically handles constraints and dependencies between hyperparameters, ensuring that only valid combinations are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: By pre-generating all valid combinations, you avoid wasting time on invalid configurations during the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: The API allows for easy implementation of various search strategies, from simple (grid search, random search) to more advanced (Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reproducibility**: The ability to generate and query specific combinations aids in reproducing experiments and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Integration**: As demonstrated, the API can be easily integrated with existing HPO libraries and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the Combinations API for HPO, you can create more efficient and effective hyperparameter tuning processes, leading to better model performance and more robust machine learning pipelines."
