HyPSTER is a Machine Learning Pipeline Optimization library built on top of [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) which provides a high-level API that can quickly and easily produce state-of-the-art results in multiple Machine Learning domains.

HyPSTER harnesses the power of FastAI, scikit-learn, XGBoost and other popular Python libraries for optimal performance.

HyPSTER allows practitioners to mix and match low and mid-level components to build custom strategies for finding optimal hyperparameters for their task.

HyPSTER includes:

*   Easy, one-line API for Tabular, Text & Vision data
*   Modular design for controlling and customizing the search procedure
*   State-of-the-art algorithms for Hyperparameter space exploration strategies
*   Build-in support for Requirements & Constraints
*   Human-Readable insights
*   Support for multiple CPU & GPU
